# Mobile-Broadband-Testing-Summarized-Data
================

CalSPEED project teams use smartphones and tablets to test at nearly 2,000 different locations around the state to measure mobile broadband service availability. 
The number was increased to 4,000 locations from summer 2020. 
The files on this repository are the summarized data which is the average of the 160 individual tests for each metric measured at each point tested.
